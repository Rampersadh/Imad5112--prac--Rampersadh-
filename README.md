This is my splash screen. I have added 2 buttons.
For the first button that is called "Get started" that allows the user to enter the app and proceed to the next screen. Where they will fill in the different field with the song information 
The second button is to exit the app
I have used canva for my background to make the app's appearance look more professional and more appiealing to the users

This is the second screen of my app. 
This is where the user will input all of the required fields and then either add to the playlist or exit the app or clear all the inputs 
I have added 4 edittext and 4 buttons
My background is also from canva so that all my screens are in unform interms of the colour 
The 4 edittext are there to help the user input the different fields so that the code can store the data that the user inputs 
The 4 buttons are there to help the user with what they want to do either to go to the next screen or to exit the app or to clear the input or to add their songs to their playlist

This is my third screen of my app
I have added 2 textViews and 3 buttons to this screen 
This is where the user will be able to view their playlist and also see their ratings and comments 
The background is important as it sets the mood of the user andor changes the mood.
